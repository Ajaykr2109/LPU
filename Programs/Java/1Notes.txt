Wrapper Class:
The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.
The automatic conversion of primitive into an object is known as autoboxing and vice-versa unboxing.

Expressions & Operators:

class OperatorExample{
public static void main(String args[]){
int a=10;
int b=10;
System.out.println(a++ + ++a);//10+12=22
System.out.println(b++ + b++);//10+11=21

}}

ques: What is an object in Java?

An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.
State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
An object is a real-world entity.
An object is a runtime entity.
The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
The object is an instance of a class.
